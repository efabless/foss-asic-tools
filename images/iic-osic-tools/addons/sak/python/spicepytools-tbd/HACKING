=========

As there are now more than one developers, we need a definition of
some coding styles rules.
This will simplify the development and keeps the code readable.


1. python code
==============

  The python code should follow the coding conventions described in PEP 8
  from python.org:
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

  The most important points are:
   
    * indentation with 4 spaces (no tabs at all)
    
    * classes may use mixedCase CamelCase or lower_case names

    * function should have lowercase or lower_case names

    * variables should use lowercase or lower_case identifiers

    * constants should use CAPITALIZED identifiers
